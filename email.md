Thank you for your sweet email, Lucy (and your text Patrick).  It was a long trip for you, but we are so very happy that you did it, and that you visited us!  What a treat to feel back in touch!  We have such wonderful memories of knowing you when we were younger, and now of when we are older. :-)   And so wonderful to meet Abi as a handsome, accomplished grown up.  We very much hope that he (and your other kids) can meet our kids and the next generation can know each other.  We'll work on that!

We hope you have a great rest of the summer!  We are eagerly awaiting a trip to the mountains with all of our grandchildren in July!  

Have a wonderful summer, and stay healthy!

Love, Connie and Stan
